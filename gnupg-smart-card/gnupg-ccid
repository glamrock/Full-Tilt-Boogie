# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/gnupg-ccid.usermap that corresponds
#    to the card reader you are using.
# b) a group "scard" where all users allowed access to the
#    card reader are listed
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named
# "gnupg-ccid" like this script.
